# Energy Efficiency Data Analysis
This work aims at relating the energy consumption of the buildings with their shape. 12 different building shapes were examined for energy analysis. There are eight input variables consisting of relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area and glazing area distribution. These input variables will be analyzed using statistical analysis to examine the effect on two output variables, namely heating load and cooling load.
